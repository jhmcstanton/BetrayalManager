# BetrayalManager

This is a simple android application aimed at supplementing the 
[Betrayal at the House on the Hill](http://boardgaming.com/games/board-games/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill)
board game. 

## Feature Goals
- Character Sheets (Complete!)
  
  Currently a user can track multiple character boards simultaneously
  
- Omen Track (Complete!)

  This is going to keep track of the current Omen Track, allow the user to perform an omen roll and then
  , eventually, spawn the Haunt Selection activity
   
- Haunt Selection (Complete!)
 
 This is the secondary main feature of the app. This is going to automatically look up the haunt when provided wit
 the relevant data (omen and room), then inform the user what haunt to lookup in the Traitor's Tome and Survivor's Manual.

This has *not* been thoroughly tested, *at all.* Feel free to use this and let me know if there are any additional features you would like, and I'd be more than happy to see about adding them.
