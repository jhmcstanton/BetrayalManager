# BetrayalManager

This is a simple android application aimed at supplementing the 
[http://boardgaming.com/games/board-games/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill](Betrayal at the House on the Hill) 
board game. 

## Feature Goals
- Character Sheets (Complete!)
  
  Currently a user can track multiple character boards simultaneously
  
- Omen Track

  This is going to keep track of the current Omen Track (complete), allow the user to perform an omen roll and then
  , eventually, spawn the Haunt Selection activity
  
- Haunt Selection
 
 This is the secondary main feature of the app. This is going to automatically look up the haunt when provided wit
 the relevant data (omen and room), then inform the user what haunt to lookup in the Traitor's Tome and Survivor's Manual.
